# Config for Thinkpad P50
-This config is based on macOS 10.12.4.

-This is a custom hackintosh configuration of my mobile workstation Thinkpad P50.
-This branch is not likely to be updated because I recently sold my P50.
-But this version is pretty complete :) 
-I got a Gigabyte Aero 15 and I love it a lot!
-Hackintosh for Aero 15 will be updated in another branch.

-The confituration is as follows:
  Xeon E3 1505M V5
  32GB DDR4 2133MHZ ECC SODIMM
  4K FlexView Screen
  WebCam
  Lexar ExpressCard SSD
  Intel HD P530 1536MB
  
-Use this configuration on your own risk as I am not responsibile for damaging anyone's system.

-This project is CLOSED.

-Happy hackintoshing!
