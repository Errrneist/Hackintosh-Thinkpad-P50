# Config for Thinkpad P50
## This config is based on macOS 10.12.4.

* This is a custom hackintosh configuration of my mobile workstation Thinkpad P50.
* This branch is not likely to be updated because I recently sold my P50.
* But this version is pretty complete :) 
* I got a Gigabyte Aero 15 and I love it a lot!
* Hackintosh for Aero 15 will be updated in another branch.

## The confituration is as follows:
* Xeon E3 1505M V5
* 32GB DDR4 2133MHZ ECC SODIMM
* 4K FlexView Screen
* WebCam
* Lexar ExpressCard SSD
* Intel HD P530 1536MB
